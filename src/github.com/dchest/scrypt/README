!!! NOTE !!!

Official go.crypto repository now includes scrypt implementation.
(http://code.google.com/p/go/source/detail?r=ad8a96e038bb&repo=crypto)
Please use it instead of this one, as it will be supported there.

Link: http://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse?repo=crypto

It is compatible with this implementation, so to switch to it,
just change the import path to "code.google.com/p/go.crypto/scrypt".

Go implementation of scrypt key derivation function.
(http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html)

INSTALLATION

    $ go get github.com/dchest/scrypt

PACKAGE
    import "github.com/dchest/scrypt"

    Package scrypt implements the scrypt key derivation function as defined
    in Colin Percival's paper "Stronger Key Derivation via Sequential
    Memory-Hard Functions".

FUNCTIONS

func Key(password, salt []byte, N, r, p, keyLen int) ([]byte, error)

    Key derives a key from the password, salt and cost parameters, returning
    a byte slice of length keyLen that can be used as cryptographic key.

    N is a CPU/memory cost parameter, must be a power of two greater than 1.
    r and p must satisfy r * p < 2³⁰. If the parameters do not satisfy the
    limits, the function returns a nil byte slice and an error.

    For example, you can get a derived key for e.g. AES-256 (which needs a
    32-byte key) by doing:

        dk := scrypt.Key([]byte("some password"), salt, 16384, 8, 1, 32)

    The recommended parameters for interactive logins as of 2009 are N=16384,
    r=8, p=1. They should be increased as memory latency and CPU parallelism
    increases. Remember to get a good random salt.
